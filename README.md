# NFL Big Data Bowl 2024 - Tackling Prediction

Welcome to the repository for my submission to the NFL Big Data Bowl 2024, focusing on tackling prediction using Next Gen Stats player tracking data.

## Overview

The National Football League's Big Data Bowl is an annual competition where participants leverage player tracking data to generate actionable insights. The theme for the 2024 edition is tackling, requiring the creation of metrics and models to evaluate defensive players' abilities to make tackles on the field.

## Project Highlights

### 1. Tackling Prediction Model

- **Neural Network Architecture:** Utilized a sophisticated neural network with three convolutional layers, batch normalization, max-pooling, and dropout for tackling prediction.
- **Feature Importance Analysis:** Employed a Random Forest model to uncover the key predictors of tackles, providing valuable insights for defensive coaching staffs.

### 2. Feature Engineering and Exploration

- **Visualizations:** Developed spatial visualizations showcasing tackling hotspots and play animations for in-depth exploration of player movements.
- **Incorporated Player Information:** Enriched tracking data with player-specific attributes such as age, height, weight, and position.
- **Offensive and Defensive Formation Impact:** Explored the impact of offensive and defensive formations on predicting tackles.

### 3. Model Performance

- **Accuracy:** Achieved a commendable accuracy of 93.7% in identifying the tackler and 76.8% accuracy in assigning the highest probability to the correct defender.
- **Real-Time Application:** Developed the model to generate probability scores for each player on a per-frame basis, providing dynamic insights during plays.
